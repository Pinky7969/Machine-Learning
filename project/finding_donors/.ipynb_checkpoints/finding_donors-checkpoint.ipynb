    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- The strengths of the decision tree model: \n",
    "  1. is its transparent nature. Unlike other decision-making models, the decision tree makes explicit all possible alternatives and traces each alternative to its conclusion in a single view, allowing for easy comparison among the various alternatives. The use of separate nodes to denote user defined decisions, uncertainties, and end of process lends further clarity and transparency to the decision-making process.\n",
    "  2. Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance: decision trees do not require any assumptions of linearity in the data. Thus, we can use them in scenarios where we know the parameters are nonlinearly related.\n",
    "  3. Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation: To overcome scale differences between parameters - for example if we have a dataset which measures revenue in millions and loan age in years, say; this will require some form of normalization or scaling before we can fit a regression model and interpret the coefficients.  Such variable transformations are not required with decision trees because the tree structure will remain the same with or without the transformation.\n",
    "- The weaknesses of the decision tree model:\n",
    "  1. Poor Resolution on Data With Complex Relationships Among the Variables: Decision Trees classify by step-wise assessment of a data point of unknown class, one node at time, starting at the root node and ending with a terminal node. And at each node, only two possibilities are possible (left-right), hence there are some variable relationships that Decision Trees just can't learn.\n",
    "  2. Interpretation: Decision Trees will never give you the right answer, it will give you many possible answers.  Change the root node of the tree to start with a different variable and you will probably get a different tree.\n",
    "  3. Poor Resolution With Continuous Expectation Variables: it's ok to have independent variables like \"download time\" or \"number of days since previous online purchase\"; however, exceptions are cases of continuous output like \"student's age\" or \"number of days\".\n",
    "  4. Unconstrained, individual trees are prone to overfitting because they can keep branching until they memorize the training data. However, this can be alleviated by using ensembles.\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  1. A Decision Tree can handle data with different types, like data with the combination of integers, ranges, and categories. \n",
    "  2. Moreover, A Decision Tree model is a good candidate for this problem as Decision Tree models are particularly adept at binary classification since it's the composition of that.\n",

    "**AdaBoost**\n",
    "- Boosting is a general ensemble method that creates a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers.This is done by building a model from the training data, then creating a second model that attempts to correct the errors from the first model. Models are added until the training set is predicted perfectly or a maximum number of models are added. AdaBoost was the first really successful boosting algorithm developed for binary classification. A framework for classifying face images using Adaboost and domain-partitioning based classifiers is addressed in (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11892755_7). Moreover, the application of literature (http://www.jos.org.cn/1000-9825/13/1361.pdf), mainly solves the two-class problem, multi-class single label problem, multi-classification and multi-label problem, class single label problem and regression problem.\n",
    "- The strengths of AdaBoost: \n",
    "  1. AdaBoost is a powerful classification algorithm that has enjoyed practical success with applications in a wide variety of fields, such as biology, computer vision, and speech processing. Unlike other powerful classifiers, such as SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings. The user only needs to choose: (1) which weak classifier might work best to solve their given classification problem; (2) the number of boosting rounds that should be used during the training phase. The GRT enables a user to add several weak classifiers to the family of weak classifiers that should be used at each round of boosting. The AdaBoost algorithm will select the weak classifier that works best at that round of boosting.\n",
    "- The weaknesses of AdaBoost:\n",
    "  1. AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. --> my mistake about this! It should be: **AdaBoost can be sensitive to outliers / label noise because it is fitting a classification model to an exponential loss function, and the exponential loss function is sensitive to outliers/label noise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  **1. Adaboost can use multiple instances of the same classifier with different parameters --> here we have different attributes which are represented in different measurements; also, AdaBoost is the combination of base estimators can result in a strong classifier that can deduce very complex and nonlinear decision boundaries as well. Thus I think maybe AdaBoost is able to handle this kind of data set.**\n",

    "**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVMs depends on supervised learning algorithms. The aim of using SVM is to correctly classify unseen data. SVMs have a number of applications in several fields. Some common applications of SVM are Face detection – SVMc classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face. (http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1322&context=etd_projects) Besides, We can also use SVMs to recognize hand-written characters that use for data entry and validating signatures on documents. (http://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume6No11/Paper_9-Handwriting_Word_Recognition_Based_on_SVM_Classifier.pdf)\n",
    "- The strengths of SVM: \n",
    "  1. It has a regularisation parameter, which makes the user think about avoiding over-fitting. \n",
    "  2. It uses the kernel trick, so you can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel.\n",
    "  3. An SVM is defined by a convex optimization problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods.\n",
    "  4. It is an approximation to abound on the test error rate, and there is a substantial body of theory behind it which suggests it should be a good idea.\n",
    "- The weaknesses of SVM:\n",
    "  1. The disadvantages are that the theory only really covers the determination of the parameters for a given value of the regularisation and kernel parameters and choice of kernel. In a way, the SVM moves the problem of over-fitting from optimizing the parameters to model selection. Sadly kernel models can be quite sensitive to over-fitting the model selection criterion, see\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "  1. Because SVM is a suitable classifier for **(1) complex data set(due to its kernel trick and hyper parameters that can penalize overfitting)**, (2) high sparsity in the problem but some of the features may have zero value. Furthermore, It uses Kernel trick and it is Optimal margin based classification technique in Machine Learning."

    "Based on the result charts, I think AdaBoost is the most appropriate model for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. First, take the look of charts in the 1st column, Training set size-to-Time(in seconds), SVM model takes the longest time on both training and prediction phase while AdaBoost is the most efficient one. Next, we focus on 2nd column of charts, Training set size-to-Accuracy score, although Decision Tree gets the highest score on training phase; however, this model in prediction phase doesn't perform well; not only it gets relatively low score, but the gaps between training and prediction phase are much more different than other two models. It means Decision Tree leads to an overfitting condition in this case. (The conclusion can be applied on 3rd column's model for Decision Tree.)\n",
    "Compare to AdaBoost and SVM mode, they both perform well, not much different when using 10%, and 100% data, but AdaBoost seems to get a little higher score than SVM. However, when dealing with fewer dataset of 1% of data, according from 3rd column chart: Training set size-to-F_score, it seems SVM unable to predict a positive result at all which cause F score to be 0.\n",

    "Imagine that you want to buy a gift for your sister, but you totally have no idea about what she'd like. There are three friends of her, the first one knows what kind of color your sister would like. The second one is very close to your sister and she always knows what your sister wants. Finally, the third one like to make some unharmful joke on her, so he knows what your sister hate or afraid of. Individually, they may not be all that useful to you, because they can do only one simple task. But if you combine them together and filter out all the object, you have a very good chance of getting an accurate list of items which are qualified. This is the concept behind AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model I choose is AdaBoost, which is an ensembling machine learning method. Imagine that we are about to deal data with many features(attributes). There is one tricky problem: even though we have many features, but not all of them are useful. SVM tries to use a very universal rule to describe every feature and make the final decision, which makes it so slow when calculating. For the worse part, too many rules make the decision too sensitive and cause more error. \n",
    "The decision tree provides a very smart way to make every decision; for example, when it comes to \"describe people who are rich\", people first think of \"how many money they earn\", \"how big the house they live in\", or \"what kind of car they drive\", rather than \"how's their color of eyeballs\" or \"is there any flower in their bedroom\". The Decision make the decision in the way people think of something; however, not every detail are as important as others. Like \"hows the color of eyeballs\" maybe not so relevant when determining how rich a person is.\n",
    "The AdaBoost works similar to the decision tree, it makes the decisions based on every feature. However, Some features can describe most data's behavior but some aren't. The AdaBoost put every decision for voting to make a conclusion, who can apply on most of the data gains the most power. After gaining all the votes to make the final result. Just like a student trying to apply for college in the field of mathematics. Not all scores are equally important, so the college puts different weights on the different subject to produce a final score, which is used to decide whether you are qualified."

    "### Question 6 - Feature Relevance Observation\n",
    "When **Exploring the Data**, it was shown there are thirteen available features for each individual on record in the census data. Of these thirteen records, which five features do you believe to be most important for prediction, and in what order would you rank them and why?"

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. education-num: With a higher education level, people tend to have higher opportunities to get the job with higher pay.\n",
    "2. occupation: Browse from the data, I found people in the job like Exec-managerial or Prof-specialty tend to have the higher income.\n",
    "3. age: I think age also means people get more experience in work, which can lead to a higher position and higher income; on the other hand, people who're too old or after the age of retire may live with limited income.\n",
    "4. relationship: I think people who're capable of having a family or raising kids may be an indicator of higher income.\n",
    "5. sex: Based on my living experience, typically, males are more likely to earn more money than females in the workplace."

In retrospect, I think I focus too much on \"personal\" condition and forget about the whole economic environment plays the most important part in this case.\n",
    "- Besides capital terms, I think the result pretty makes sense even though I only got the right answer on \"age\" and \"education-num\". As for \"hours-per-week\", I think this result tries to explain \"people who spend more time on work, they will earn more from their effort\"; however,  I misunderstood its means by think of \"people who can work in an efficient way or work hard are all able to earn more money\", hence I thought based on working time may not be a feature to make the decision.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
